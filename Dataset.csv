PROFESSIONAL QUALITY AND RAZOR-SHARP - The cutting blade is made from AUS-10 steel. AUS-10 is 58-61 HRC (Rockwell hardness) and is one of the highest grades of high carbon extra strength stainless steel made in Japan. The cutting blade is sandwiched between 33 layers of Damascus steel, resulting in a blade consisting of 67 layers. This is an excellent knife that is highly durable, corrosion and rust-resistant, and sharp like a KATANA (Japanese sword).
HANDLE IS DESIGNED FOR FUNCTIONALITY - The handle is simple, with a focus on functionality, eliminating unnecessary decoration. The blade is perfectly welded to a 430 stainless steel handle to make a full tang. The steel handle is sandwiched between polished jet-black pakka wood and finished with rivets at three points. This makes it ideal for durability and won’t cause the handle to loosen or rattle even after long-term use.
THE OPTIMAL BALANCE - Extremely sharp blades are often easily chipped. However, we have designed this knife's blade with a 13-degree angle per side, which is the optimal balance between sharpness and chipping resistance. We’ve also created an ergonomically shaped handle in order to provide a well-balanced grip that won’t make you tired even after extended use.
BEAUTIFUL DAMASCUS STEEL KNIFE DESIGNED IN TOKYO, JAPAN - In addition to the performance and functionality, the Damascus steel with its wave-like patterns, gives this knife the mysterious beauty of Asia.

[BPA Free PE & PP Plastic] Set includes 1 PE dough scraper with curved edges, and 1 PP dough cutter with straight edge, both made from food grade plastic, safe to be part of the homemade bread making process. They won’t stick to wet dough, won’t rust like metal, won’t break as some cheap plastic. You cake make pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving and this helped with the pie crust that stuck a little on the board. Easy to clean, as they are supposed to be.
[Dough Scraper with Curved Edges] Made from PE plastic, it has a certain amount of flexibility to bend and conform to the sides of the bowl and gets everything out nicely without breaking itself. Its dimensions (4.6×3.7 in) and tiny crumbs on the surface are to provide a strong and comfortable grip. When handling wet dough like sourdough bread, these make the folding much easier in addition to the cleanup of the counter. Just scrape any annoying mess even moist things into a trash can.
[Dough Scraper with Straight Edge] The one with straight edge (5.2×4.1×3.6in) is relatively rigid than the one with curved edges. When handling bread dough, you need a cutter with clean edge and strong enough to cut the dough neatly into even pieces, but not so sharp to ruin your baking mat, or worse, your hands. It should not be flexible, because you need its sturdiness to bear the pressure for you when kneading, shaping, lifting the dough, or smoothing the cake frosting cream sometimes.
"[Bread Baking Must-Have] You can use one flexible scraper to get the wet dough out of the mixing bowl, but you will soon face troubles when use it to cut dough, to shape it, or to lift it. So you bought a hard one, but it ends up in breaking when you try to conform it to the sides of the bowl. But a set of two different scrapers shall last long and behave well. Let the flexible one do the tasks like clean dough crumbs inside the bowl, and let the tough one do the kneading work."""

DESIGN-Constructed from durable and lightweight walnut wood,our edge guards are a great addition to any Findking knife.The advantage our edge guards have over everyone else's is that on the underneath of the Edge guard there is a magnetic piece that when turned 90 degrees will act as a table stand for your knives.The aesthetics and functionality will wow everyone who sees you with these edge guards.Imagine what will happen when those same people see you double your edge guard as a table stand!
QUALITY-After repeatedly testing and developing our edge guards,we have confidently come to our conclusion product.This conclusion product is what you are spending your hard earned money on.We would be remiss if the product that is supposed to protect your knives is not up to quality.Through development,our focus has been to offer a quality functioning edge guard that will protect your knives well into the future.
WEIGHT/BALANCE-These two aspects are very important to Us.The walnut wood chosen allows the user to keep the weight down for traveling to and from work in a backpack or knife roll.The average weight per edge guards is +/- 1.5 ounces.We think that shouldn’t mean you sacrifice your back like you just started a new year of School and don’t like to use your locker.

G-10 Handle material. G-10 was originally developed by Westinghouse and has proved its toughness and durability in challenging electrical and mechanical device applications. G-10 is constructed from strong and durable fiberglass layers and epoxy resin and formed under high temperature and pressure. The resulting material is incredibly strong, highly resistant to temperature, impervious to moisture and when polished has a beautiful deep shine.
Unmatched quality. Blades are forged from the finest high-carbon stainless steel from Solingen, Germany (Grade 4116) or Lamson’s proprietary USA 420HC-LAM. Durable design. Our blades are precision forged using the traditional hot-drop method, or precision laser-cut and tempered to a perfect hardness of 58 on the Rockwell scale. This results in hard, wickedly sharp blades that retains an edge for longer and are both highly corrosion resistant and elastic.
Superior performance. Full tang blades with double or triple riveted handles ensure ideal balance and weight. A curved and recessed bolster provides a seamless transition from handle to blade, resulting in comfortable thumb and finger support for better control and safety.

There are several different VG stainless steels. Kataoka selected V-G No. 5 stainless steel for the SAN TSUBAME knives, because V-G No. 5 can be hardened as hard as any of the other V-G steels but has superior edge retention.
The edge on the SAN TSUBAME knives is a minute, beveled edge. The angle of the edge is between 14 and 15 degrees. To appreciate the quality of the edge, you must first look at its incredible mirror polish and then try cutting with it.
The blade of the SAN TSUBAME is hand-hammered about half way down from the spine. The whole blade is then sandblasted. The sandblasting only affects the softer SUS410 outside layers leaving the outside layers with a matte finish and the VG No. 5 core with a mirror polish

The 3-ply stainless steel has an original thickness of 20 mm and is thinned by repeated rolling to a thickness of 2 mm. You might want to look at this rolling process as a modern forging technique. Also, this rolling process removes all the impurities in the steel leaving you with a very hard, very pure stainless steel.
After the rolling processes, the V-G No. 5 cutting edge reaches a hardness of 61 degrees on the Rockwell scale and a final thickness of .65 mm. The outside layers each reach a thickness of .675 mm. There are several different VG stainless steels. Kataoka selected V-G No. 5 stainless steel for the SAN TSUBAME knives, because V-G No. 5 can be hardened as hard as any of the other V-G steels but has superior edge retention.
Using scientific testing equipment (CATRA), Kataoka was able to show that their knives stayed sharper longer than knives made from other VG steels. The edge on the SAN TSUBAME knives is a minute, beveled edge. The angle of the edge is between 14 and 15 degrees. To appreciate the quality of the edge, you must first look at its incredible mirror polish and then try cutting with it.
Kataoka has achieved the perfect balance between sharpness and strength with the SAN TSUBAME edges.
"The blade of the SAN TSUBAME is hand-hammered about half way down from the spine. The whole blade is then sandblasted. The sandblasting only affects the softer SUS410 outside layers leaving the outside layers with a matte finish and the VG No. 5 core with a mirror polish. The hammering and sandblasting give the SAN TSUBAME a very rich appearance."""
Bread Knifes are designed to give precise cuts on loafs of bread, no matter how soft.
Blade is serrated so that you can slice through loafs without smashing the bread
"Blade is 8"""" in length"
The blade is curved slightly. This means that you can cut with a subtle rocking motion, which will allow you to glide through the cheese more smoothly.
Your hands will be free of the table while cutting due to the high handles. This allows you to work safely and carefully.
Perfect for the Pro or Advanced Home Chef

What is Deba Bocho? Deba bōchō (literally: pointed carving knife) are Japanese style kitchen carvers primarily used to cut fish, though also used when cutting meat.
The deba bōchō first appeared during the Edo period in Sakai City.
It is designed to behead and fillet fish. Its thickness, and often a more obtuse angle on the back of the heel allow it to cut off the heads of fish without damage.
The rest of the blade is then used to ride against the fish bones, separating the fillet. Traditionally, they were made of carbon steel, which need regular maintenance and oiling to prevent rust. However, our modern knives are available as stainless steel, which are safe for washing. The deba is not intended for chopping large diameter bones.

Beautifully mirror-finished, this knife is part of a Special Forged series resulting in a VG-10 Yanagi is truly exceptional quality and has a higher grade of fit and finish than our standard VG-10 Yanagi. This Special Limited Edition grade SVG-10 Semi-Stainless Steel Yanagi (HRC 62-63) combines exceptional sharpness and optimal edge retention with stain resistance. The hard steel of the VG-10 allows for a superior sharpness and edge retention while the softer, surrounding steel adds durability.
The Yanagi Kiritsuke is a long slicing knife that was designed to slice thin slices of fish for sushi and sashimi, and is one of the most essential of traditional Japanese knives and is a powerful component in the repertoire of many chefs. The Yanagi Kiritsuke is slightly heavier than the Yanagi with a blade that is wider and a spine that is thicker. The sword tip helps balance the weight of the knife and is recommended for chefs who are interested in a Yanagi but prefer a heftier knife.
Handcrafted in Japan with traditional techniques, our Yanagi Kiritsuke has a completely flat grind on the front side (Shinogi), a concave grind (Urasuki), and a flat rim (Uraoshi) on the back. The combination of the Urasuki and Shinogi allow for the blade to cut food with minimal damage to the surface and cells, therefore not spoiling the texture and taste. The Uraoshi is the thin, flat rim that surrounds the Urasuki and enhances the strength of the blade at its otherwise vulnerable edges.

The Dalstrong Touch: Full tang and precision forged from a single piece of ice tempered, high-carbon, Japanese AUS-8 steel at 58+ Rockwell hardness, the Phantom Series boasts exceptional sharpness, edge retention, strength and durability. Beautifully engraved, the blade further features a hand polished spine and ergonomic bolster shape for a natural and smooth ‘pinch grip’.
Design Perfection: A velvety rich black Spanish pakkawood handle is hand polished and laminated to ensure a heaven like grip with exceptional durability. The traditional Japanese D-shaped handle is expertly engineered to tuck perfectly into the palm of your hand for ultimate control, cut after cut, while the narrow blade design allows for maneuverability and nimble movement like never before.

Our handmade Yoshihiro Kasumi knives are crafted by our master artisans with the utmost care to create high quality knives that offer exceptional performance with exceptional value. White Steel #2 with a hardness on the Rockwell scale of 62-63, is forged with iron to create beautiful mist patterns called Kasumi.
The Yanagi is a long slicing knife that was specifically designed to slice thin slices of fish for sushi and sashimi, and is one of the most essential of traditional Japanese knives and is a powerful component in the repertoire of many chefs. The beauty of its elegant thin blade is its ability to slice through an ingredient in long uninterrupted strokes, preserving its integrity and freshness.
Handcrafted in Japan with traditional techniques, our Yanagi has a completely flat grind on the front side (Shinogi), a concave grind (Urasuki), and a flat rim (Uraoshi) on the back. The combination of the Urasuki and Shinogi allow for the blade to cut food with minimal damage to the surface and cells, therefore not spoiling the texture and taste. The Uraoshi is the thin, flat rim that surrounds the Urasuki and enhances the strength of the blade at its otherwise vulnerable edges.
Proudly made in Japan and not mass produced. This knife is complimented with a traditional Japanese Wa-style handcrafted D-Shaped Handle that is lightweight and ergonomically welds to the hand for seamless use.

Our Yoshihiro High Speed Steel series beautifully brings together incredible sharpness, long lasting edge retention, stain resistance, and an ease of sharpening that outclasses many other knives currently on the market.

Our handmade Yoshihiro Hongasumi knives are crafted with extraordinary skill by our master artisans to create high quality knives that are indispensable in their craftsmanship and performance. Blue Steel #2 with a hardness on the Rockwell scale of 63 to 64, is forged with iron to create beautiful mist patterns, and an emphasis is placed on refined forging and polishing with the highest attention to detail.
One of the most sought after of knives and fast becoming a new essential companion to the popular chefs knife is the traditional Japanese vegetable knife known as the Edo Usuba. The Edo Usuba is reminiscent of a small cleaver and has a blunt tip that comes in handy for such things as cutting the eye out of a potato. This knife is cherished for its ability to chop through root vegetables to thinly slicing delicate tomatoes.
Handcrafted in Japan with traditional techniques, our Usuba has a completely flat grind on the front side (Shinogi), a concave grind (Urasuki), and a flat rim (Uraoshi) on the back. The combination of the Urasuki and Shinogi allow for the blade to cut food with minimal damage to the surface and cells, therefore not spoiling the texture and taste. The Uraoshi is the thin, flat rim that surrounds the Urasuki and enhances the strength of the blade at its otherwise vulnerable edges.

Beautifully mirror-finished, our handmade Yoshihiro Honyaki knives are handcrafted with extraordinary skill. A work of art, the temper line (hamon) features the Fuji mountain with a Full Moon. Honyaki means “true forged” and represents the highest level in Japanese knives, an extraordinary blade hand-forged from a single piece of high carbon steel.
Handcrafted in Japan with traditional techniques, our Kiritsuke has a completely flat grind on the front side (Shinogi), a concave grind (Urasuki), and a flat rim (Uraoshi) on the back. The combination of the Urasuki and Shinogi allow for the blade to cut food with minimal damage to the surface and cells, therefore not spoiling the texture and taste. The Uraoshi is the thin, flat rim that surrounds the Urasuki and enhances the strength of the blade at its otherwise vulnerable edges.

The Takobiki is a long slicing knife that was designed to slice paper-thin slices of fish for sashimi and its blunt sharp tip is useful for cutting the long tentacles of the octopus. The Takobiki is narrower and thinner than a Yanagi which means it is lighter but is also more delicate to use. The Takobiki has a flatter blade profile compared to the Yanagi and can slice through an ingredient in long uninterrupted strokes, preserving its integrity and freshness.
Handcrafted in Japan with traditional techniques, our Takobiki has a completely flat grind on the front side (Shinogi), a concave grind (Urasuki), and a flat rim (Uraoshi) on the back. The combination of the Urasuki and Shinogi allow for the blade to cut food with minimal damage to the surface and cells, therefore not spoiling the texture and taste. The Uraoshi is the thin, flat rim that surrounds the Urasuki and enhances the strength of the blade at its otherwise vulnerable edges.
Proudly made in Japan and not mass produced. This knife is complimented with a traditional Japanese Wa-style handcrafted Octagonal Handle that is lightweight and ergonomically welds to the hand for seamless use. A protective wood sheath called a Saya is included, which protects the knife and adds to its appearance when not in use. Every knife from Yoshihiro is handcrafted by master artisans creating a unique one-of-a-kind work of art.
Our handmade Yoshihiro Honyaki knives are handcrafted with extraordinary skill, forged of the highest quality steel according to the traditional methods used in ancient Japanese sword making by our master artisans of incomparable skill, some of which have over 50 years of experience. Honyaki means true forged and represents the highest level in Japanese knives, an extraordinary blade hand-forged from a single piece of high carbon steel.
